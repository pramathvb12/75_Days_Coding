'''
Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

Example



Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day,  with a length equalling his birth month, . In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria:  and .

Function Description

Complete the birthday function in the editor below.

birthday has the following parameter(s):

int s[n]: the numbers on each of the squares of chocolate
int d: Ron's birth day
int m: Ron's birth month
Returns

int: the number of ways the bar can be divided
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of squares in the chocolate bar.
The second line contains  space-separated integers , the numbers on the chocolate squares where .
The third line contains two space-separated integers,  and , Ron's birth day and his birth month.

There are two -element arrays of integers,  and . Permute them into some  and  such that the relation  holds for all  where .

There will be  queries consisting of , , and . For each query, return YES if some permutation ,  satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

Example



A valid  is  and :  and . Return YES.

Function Description

Complete the twoArrays function in the editor below. It should return a string, either YES or NO.

twoArrays has the following parameter(s):

int k: an integer
int A[n]: an array of integers
int B[n]: an array of integers
Returns
- string: either YES or NO

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.

The next  sets of  lines are as follows:

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the size of both arrays  and , and the relation variable.
The second line contains  space-separated integers .
