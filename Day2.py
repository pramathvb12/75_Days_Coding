Task 1
Given an integer, , and  space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, , of those  integers. Then compute and print the result of .

Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in the tuple.
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the elements in tuple .

Output Format

Print the result of hash(t).
'''

# solution

# taking input
n = int(input())
elem = map(int, input().split())
# create tuple
t = tuple(elem)
# hash value
print(hash(t))

'''
task 2
The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

Example
The query_name is 'beta'. beta's average score is .

Input Format

The first line contains the integer , the number of students' records. The next  lines contain the names and marks obtained by a student, each value separated by a space. The final line contains query_name, the name of a student to query.

Constraints

Output Format

Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.
